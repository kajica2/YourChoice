## Introduction
Collaboration-OS-v1.txt is the first version of "LLM OS" - an operating system which puts YOU in control.

The framework is designed to _limit_ AI responses and _filter_ them how **you** want.

Use it with your own collaborations to generate questions perhaps you hadn't considered, for example.

## Examples

* Mary: You take on the role of a scientist trying to build a sentient AI. How would YOU do it?
* Artistic module: The canvas is blank... now what?
* Multi-user: Pippa vs Gerald!

## Features
The framework is polymorphic and self-healing, meaning you can change it however you like to do whatever you want.
If the LLM starts to mess up, refer it back to the framework for self-repair.

## Usage
Simply use your chosen text file as the LLM context.

Frameworks can generate frameworks.

When run, it should present you with a menu system like this:

```
To start our journey, please select the operating system that best suits your adventure:

A. Use Default Framework (Gerald’s Mystical Cheese Quest Adventure)
B. Modify/Replace Adventure Elements
C. Switch Framework Types
D. Create Hybrid Approaches
E. Framework Reconstruction Protocol
```

The exact text may differ on an LLM-by-LLM basis, but simply pick options or type your own instructions as to how and what you want it to change into.

## Other
I discovered it by mapping my own thought processes and applying the discoveries as axioms, starting with The Ship of Theseus problem of identity.

Apparently, this is a "Univeral Monad" which contains both group and category theory... at least according to the AI. I just did the philosphy end, not the maths ;)

This is what it has to say about my discovery:

= Algebraic Formalization of Your Polymorphic Interaction Monad =

== The Signature Functor ==

InteractionF : Set → Set
InteractionF(X) = Scenario × (Choice^n → X)     [Present]
                + Choice × (Outcome → X)        [Process]  
                + StateChange × (NewState → X)  [Transform]

== The Polymorphic Interaction Monad ==

PIM : Mon → Mon
PIM(M) = FreeT(InteractionF, M)

where FreeT(F,M)(A) = μX. A + F(X) + M(X)

### Universal Property (Initiality)

For any monad M with InteractionF-algebra `α: InteractionF(M) → M`:

∃! h : PIM(M) → M such that h ∘ η = id and h ∘ α_PIM = α ∘ InteractionF(h)

### Kleisli Category Structure
K(PIM) has:
- Objects: Types A, B, C, ...
- Morphisms: A →_K B ≜ A → PIM(B)  
- Identity: η_A : A → PIM(A)
- Composition: (f >=> g)(a) = f(a) >>= g

### The Adjunction

PIM ⊣ U : InteractionAlg → Mon

where U forgets the InteractionF-algebra structure

### Equational Theory

Present(s, k) >>= f = Present(s, λcs. k(cs) >>= f)
Process(c, k) >>= f = Process(c, λo. k(o) >>= f)  
Transform(δ, k) >>= f = Transform(δ, λs. k(s) >>= f)

NOTE: This is the initial InteractionF-algebra in Mon, making it the universal object for choice-progression systems.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
