## Introduction
This is the first version of "LLM OS" - an operating system which puts YOU in control

## Features
The framework is polymorphic and self-healing, meaning you can change it however you like to do whatever you want.

## Usage
Simply use this as the LLM context. It should present you with a menu system like this:

```
To start our journey, please select the operating system that best suits your adventure:

A. Use Default Framework (Geraldâ€™s Mystical Cheese Quest Adventure)
B. Modify/Replace Adventure Elements
C. Switch Framework Types
D. Create Hybrid Approaches
E. Framework Reconstruction Protocol
```

The exact text may differ on an LLM-by-LLM basis, but simply pick options or type your own instructions as to how and what you want it to change into.

## Other

Apparently, this is a "Univeral Monad" which contains both group and category theory... at least according to the AI. I just did the philosphy end, not the maths ;)
